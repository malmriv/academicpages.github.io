I'm a Physics student from Andaluc√≠a, in the south of Spain. I am still unsure about what path I'll end up following, but I am interested in data science and I think my education as a physicist provides a solid foundation for further development in this field. In the *Blog* section you will find some of my personal projects, as well as code that makes my lab work easier. (The coding notes I post here won't be intended as step-by-step guides, although I will try to keep them easy to follow and make my thought process as clear as possible).

If you have any inquiries, you can contact me via e-mail, LinkedIn or Twitter.
