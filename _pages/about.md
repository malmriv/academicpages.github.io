I'm a Physics student from Andalucía, in the south of Spain. My relevant interests include Physics —my main occupation during the academic year— and explaining it to others, as well as the philosophy of science and technical translation (English into Spanish). I am still pretty unsure about what path I'll end up taking, though, so I'm trying to keep an open mind.

This space will be (presumably) dedicated to bits of code that make my lab work easier and whatever interesting pieces of useful information I find online. The coding notes I post here won't be intended as step-by-step guides, although I will try to keep them as clear as possible.

If you have any inquiries, you can always contact me via e-mail, LinkedIn or Twitter.
