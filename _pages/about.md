I'm a Physics student from Andalucía (in the south of Spain). My relevant interests include data science, languages and, of course, Physics.

My lab work frequently involves cleaning, processing and interpreting data, so I thought I could share whatever interesting techniques and results I find along the way. My tool of choice is R, which I find powerful enough for most applications, although I am also comfortable using Fortran for high-volume data processing. I am also learning Python —because of its versatility— at the moment. On a good day I am also into the philosophy of science and science popularization (although time is scarce!) and I have some experience in technical translation (English to Spanish) in various fields.

If you have any inquiries, you can always contact me via e-mail, LinkedIn or Twitter.
