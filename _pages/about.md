I'm a Physics student from Andaluc√≠a (in the south of Spain). My relevant interests include data science, languages and, of course, Physics.

My lab work frequently involves cleaning, processing and interpreting data, so I thought I could share whatever interesting techniques and solutions I find along the way. Besides data science, I am also interested in Physics (my main occupation during the academic year), explaining it to others, the philosophy of science, and technical translation (English into Spanish).

If you have any inquiries, you can always contact me via e-mail, LinkedIn or Twitter.
