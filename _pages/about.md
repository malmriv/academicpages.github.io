I'm a Physics student from Andalucía (in the south of Spain). My relevant interests include data science, languages and, of course, physics and mathematics.

My lab work frequently involves cleaning, processing and interpreting data, so I thought I could share whatever interesting techniques and results I find along the way. My tool of choice is R, which I find powerful enough for most applications, although I am also comfortable using Fortran for high-volume data processing. I am also learning Python —because of its versatility— at the moment. I am also interested in the philosophy of science, science popularization and I have some experience in technical translation (English to Spanish) in various fields.

If you have any inquiries, you can contact me via e-mail, LinkedIn or Twitter.
