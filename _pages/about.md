Hello! My name is Manuel, and I'm a physicist based in Granada (Spain). In the [Blog](https://malmriv.github.io/year-archive/) section you will find some of my personal notes; my CV can be found [here](https://malmriv.github.io/cv/). Some of my interests include computational physics, data science, linguistics, languages and literature. While there is a lot to be said about those, this site will be reserved for things related to my academic and professional interests. 

If you have any inquiries, you can contact me via e-mail [via email](mailto:malmriv@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malmriv/).
