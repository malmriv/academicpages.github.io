Science, a more uncertain undertaking than most people realise, is being pinned as a shortcut to absolute truth. Are we on the right path? I use this article to point at some paradigmatic cases where renowned scientists have shown to lack a basic understanding of how science works. I try to make the case that our future scientists need to understand that science is not immune to misconceptions, that disagreeing is fundamental (even if unpleasant) and that one needs to leave the orthodoxy apart sometimes. (In Spanish).
