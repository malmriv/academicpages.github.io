Yesterday, as I was getting ready for a study session, I noticed again that strange shape that appears every once in a while in my coffee cup. Especially at night, when all the light in my room comes from a single point and the reflections, the refractions and the strangeness of light becomes more apparent.

So I started wondering, why that shape? Where does it come from? Can its equation be found easily? So, instead of actually studying for my Optics exam, I took up a very elaborate form of procrastination (the kind that makes you end up solving a complicated system of trig equations of Mathematica because the alternative is even more boring).
