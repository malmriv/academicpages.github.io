Yesterday, as I was getting ready for a study session, I noticed that strange shape that pops up every once in a while in my coffee cup. It happens especially at night, when all the light in my room comes from a single lamp and the reflections, the refractions and the strangeness of light becomes more apparent.

I started wondering, why that shape? Where does it come from? Can its equation be found easily? So, instead of actually studying for my Optics class, I took up a very elaborate form of procrastination. And by very elaborate I mean the kind that makes you end up solving a system of trig equations on Mathematica. (To be continued.)
