## PAULA is here!

Hey there! It's been a while since the![polarisation-of-light.png]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/polarisation-of-light.png)
 last time I posted here. Life has been busy and everything has been going great.

Last year, I took a physical chemistry class which had to do with the behaviour and analysis of biomolecules (mainly proteins and nucleic acids). It was fun to step outside of my comfort zone and being in a chemistry lab again, and I had a great deal of fun learning stuff that I do not normally deal with. The course worked by alternating theory classes (where we learned the formal aspect of the techniques and results we hoped to obtain empirically) and lab sessions. We were given a small sample of the problem molecule which we wanted to characterise over a period of two-or-so months, which in this case was [hen egg-white lysozyme](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Hen_Egg-White_%28HEW%29_Lysozyme), a cheap and common protein. One of the sessions's goal was to pass polarised ultraviolet light through a sample of this protein, and measure how well the protein is able to twist the plane of the incident light rays. This technique is called far-ultraviolet circular dychroism, and it turns out that learning about the way a protein interacts with these particular wavelengths in this particular sense yields a great deal of information about it's structure!

Since proteins are very complex molecules they can be studied at different levels. Since they are somewhat like chains, one can study the links that make them (that is, the sequence of aminoacids that define a molecule). This is the primary structure of a protein. Furthermore, these links organise themselves spatially in all sorts of patterns, like little sheets, helices, coils and so on. This is called the secondary structure of a protein. There are two more levels of abstraction, but this will suffice for now, because circular dychroism yields information about the secondary structure of a protein! By finding out how light
