Andaluc√≠a, the southernmost community in peninsular Spain, just celebrated its regional holiday. Every 28th of February, students all over Andaluc√≠a gather in their playgrounds and eat the much-celebrated ‚Äúpanaceite‚Äù: a slice of bread with locally made olive oil, as well as stuff like chocolate, sugar or green beans. People wish each other a happy day on social media, but there‚Äôs a (very unimportant) problem: the Andalusian flag does not exist in emoji form. The flag, which consists of three green-white-green horizontal stripes, looks really similar to the Nigerian flag, the only relevant difference being the vertical disposition of the latter. But that does not seem to be a problem for most.

So I was wondering: what would a heat map of the usage of the üá≥üá¨ emoji look like? Is the online Andalusian frenzy enough for a trend to be noticeable? I set to find out, and the results have been interesting. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/malmriv/twitter_heatmap). Some of the things I figured out:

 * Very few people geo-tag their tweets. In my sample of ~ 32.000 tweets, only about 7% had coordinates attached.
 * Most tweets come from Lagos, the most populated city in Nigeria:

 * Andalusians do leave a trace, according to this script. They're also the main source of tweets in Spain:

 * There is a local football team from a Northern town with a population of 9.000 whose flag is very similar to that of Nigeria. Took me a while to figure out why there was a small focus in the north of the country, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. The focus is not pictured in any of the images, though.
